Several friends working in the health care sector have asked for my thoughts on personal finance. While I'm not a financial advisor by training, I do find the current resources a bit lacking, if not entirely misleading.

As a student of engineering and finance, and currently working at a global investment bank, I look at personal finance under the same framework as that of complex financial derivatives. That is, I break it down into simpler components, and understand each risk metric individually.

While this is a blog on personal finance, at the end of the day, remember to prioritize your life. Remember, a few extra bucks won't replace family time and the graveyards are full of indispensable people.
