The Savings Ratio is simply how much you save compared to how much post-tax income you made in a year. If you ignore all the other suggestions in this blog, like how you should [Credit Card Churn]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/01/04/credit-card_churn/), Salary Sacrifice or potentially Switch Superfunds, and just focus on one thing - this is it. It's the most important factor and the one that will make the biggest difference to your long term financial health.

> The primary reason why tracking this ratio is important is that it puts into perspective how your spending translates directly into how many extra years you <i>have</i> to work to reach financial independence.

By looking at your spending as equivalent years of work, you are then accountable for trading aways units of your <i>life</i> in exchange for every purchase.

So how does the math work? The industry standard is to assume a long-term safe withdrawal rate of 4%. That means that for every $100 you have saved and invested, you expect to generate $4 from investments every year, after taxes and inflation, that you can safely spend. We'll discuss this assumption in another article.

With a 4% real investment return that we can withdraw safely, we can now see how different savings ratios directly affect how many years it takes before you're financially independent. Financial independence here is defined as when your expected real investment returns are higher than your expenses. That is, the money coming in from your savings is equal or higher than the money you're spending each year. This is the point when you can live indefinitely without a job or other sources of income.

This non-linear graph sums up the powerful double effect of improving your savings ratio. By increasing the percentage you save, you both: 
* Have more to invest in future years
* Require less to sustain your future indefinite expenses

In this way, it's actually more important to reduce your spending than to increase your income - if your spending increases at the same rate as your income, the time till financial independence remains the same.

For those in the far left of the graph above, the gains are the most substantial. Moving from saving 10% to 20% of your post-tax income, you save yourself 17.7 years of work. From 50% to 60%, you save 4.7 years of work. If you achieve savings ratios anywhere above 80%, your expected years to financial independence is less than 6 years! What to be able to retire in 10 years? Simply live on 30% of your take-home pay.

What to do from here? Well, first you need to know how much you're spending compared to how much take-home pay you receive by tracking your expenses. Then, it means looking at your purchases and asking yourself, "Would I work an extra <i>X</i> years for this?" 

It also means that as your income increases, it becomes an opportunity to increase your savings ratio by keeping expenses the same. That is, avoid lifestyle inflation (where expenses continue to increase at the same rate as your income) to achieve a better savings ratio and reach financial independence earlier.

Tracking your spending is the first step towards personal finance. Knowing where you spend money allows you to
1. Let you know how much money you need to sustain your livestyle
2. Effectively cut back on the things that aren't bringing you a lot of value

## Details

In the explanations above, there are various assumptions built into the calculations. It's important (on a second-order level) to know what these assumptions are for you to evaluate whether the above graph is realistic. So here I outline the assumptions as well as why they are reasonable (or atleast, achievable).

* Your current annual expenses equals your annual expenses post financial independence

    * This assumption can be difficult to uphold if you envision a larger family post financial independence. While there are definitely cost savings for each additional family member, having extra kids and their related costs can add to your annual expenses.
    * At the same time, if you choose to retire to look after your kids, there are usually some costs saved directly related to your employment, including Union/membership fees, Continuing-training program, transportation and general maintenance costs that can be saved. Travel costs may also be reduced if holidays become more localized.

* Real return on investment is the same as safe withdrawal rate

    * This was made to simplify the math above, and protects your principal savings from shrinking.
    * In effect, it logically makes sense that your withdrawal rate post financial independence should be no higher than the return on investment from the saved principal.
    
* Return on investment is a fixed percentage (4% above), post-tax and inflation, every year

    * Clearly, returns on investments are never the same year-on-year. Both investment returns, inflation and possibly your tax rate will change from year to year.
    * However, the assumption makes the math a little simpler, and if you want to look at the probability distributions based on an estimate of varying return on investments, the chart above shows a 1 standard deviation and 2 standard deviation expectation of retirement based on an annualized volatility of 17% for the return on investment. 
    * We can see that in worst case scenarios (top edge of shaded region), the years to retirement are not too different from our base case assumption, and also collapses as we increase our savings ratio.
