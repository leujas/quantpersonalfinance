Typically, the largest 4 categories of expenses on an annual basis are Accomodation, Food, Transportation and Travel.

Among these, we can discuss various strategies to reduce them, but by far the easiest expense to *reduce* or *eliminate* is Travel - through bonus introductory credit card points. 

Before we go any further in explaining the rationale of exploiting credit cards, let's go through the disclaimers. This strategy is only for people who:

- Will use it for normal spending that [otherwise would've occured anyway]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/01/01/savings-ratio/ "Which is why you need to track your expenses!")[^1]

- Would ensure they pay off the credit card bill in full every month to avoid all interest costs[^2]

- Are not getting a (home) loan in the near future[^3]

There are two main economic reasons why everyone who fits the above criteria should undergo the effort of credit card churning. First, the dollar value of bonus introductory points is high relative to effort required to pay bills. Second, economically, spending money on debit cards is the same as financially subsidising people who spend using credit cards.

### Dollar Value

The first question people have when looking at bonus introductory points is, "How much are those points worth anyway?" While each type of credit has their own benefits and dollar conversion, a quick google search indicates that "In 2018, Qantas points redeemed for flights were worth closer to 1.1 cents on domestic, and 0.7 cents on international, while Virgin points are worth around 1 cent for domestic and 0.7 cents for international."

So on the best deals out there, which generally offer 100,000 points (given some minimum spend within the first 1-3 months), is worth anywhere between $700 - $1,100. Since Qantas typically allows you to toggle between paying with points or dollars, the conversion they implement is very clear - at roughly 0.6c per point, we get $600[^4] to spend on flights/hotels from 100,000 Qantas points. Churn 3 to 4 cards a year, and you've netted yourself a cool $1,800 - $2,400 in travel credit.

In practice, the potential savings are even higher. This is because airlines will typically fluctuate the cost of flights depending on demand and how far away the flights are. However, sometimes, the points required for the flight will remain fixed. Cathay Pacific's Asia Miles redemption is one such example, where points for a flight are typically fixed and don't change despite seasonal demands. So if you have an urgent flight within the next 2 weeks, it can often be cheaper to pay via points than in dollars. 

One extra thing to note about using frequent flyer points for travel. You should almost always only use these points for personal travel that isn't tax deductible. Since if you go on a work-related trip/ need to attend a work-related conference and you meet the conditions for deducting your travel from your taxes, it is almost always more beneficial to do so and pay directly (with the credit card!). 

### Economics

As a fairly socialist regime, with a steep progressive tax system, Australia doesn't have too many exploitable systems. Credit cards, is however, one of them. 

Those with a good credit standing via stable employment and above average salaries should take advantage of their credit serviceability, which is one of the few exploitable differentiators that can result in direct monetary gain. 

> Rumor has it that in under China's Social Credit Scoring system, those with too lower of a social credit cannot board planes or trains. In Australia, individual credit scores and the exploitation of credit cards economically lowers the cost of travel, resulting, in principle, in similar outcomes.

In fact, it's the effect is even more dramatic than that. The existence of credit cards doesn't just reduce costs for those using credit cards, it also increases costs for everyone who doesn't! Fundamentally, using a debit card (or Cash), is the same as subsidizing those who use credit cards. 

The economic transfer occurs out-of-sight. Just ask yourself how do these credit card companies make enough money to justify giving away $600 of value for every successful applicant. Their main source of revenue comes from (1) people who pay interest, and (2) companies are charged a fee for processing the credit cards.

So you'll notice that often, for Visa and Mastercard transactions, you will be asked to pay an extra 1-2% for the transaction. For Amex, the cost is usually higher, around 3%. This is the retail business passing on the processing cost to you. However, there exists many businesses who would prefer to simply increase the costs of the goods/services by 1-3% instead. With enough business who do this, the processing cost is partially passed on to those without credit cards. 

So those who don't have enough credit to obtain credit cards end up subsidizing those who do. How much are they subsidizing? Well, a basic estimate[^5] would indicate that non-credit card holders are forking out >$1,000 each to subsidize the credit card system.

If this isn't akin to a regressive tax system, I don't know what is.

### Credit Card evaluation

There are various sources that evaluate the merits of each credit card's bonus introductory points, including PointsHacks and NerdWallet. Personally, I just simply look at the ratio between Bonus Points and Annual Fee. 

At the time of writing, I am using the Citibank Visa Signature card which gives 100,000 points per $49 annual fee (Qantas fee), with a minimum of $5,000 spend in the first 3 months[^6]. I'm also looking forward to Amex's next 100,000 bonus points card, as I've just come off the 18 months waiting period for Amex to consider me a *new* customer. 

In theory, if you can meet the minimum spend requirements for the credit card with your normal spend, you should always apply for all cards with give you a net positive return. You should however, take into consideration the non-zero cost of time required to apply and maintain the card, as well as potentially waiting for better deals from the same company if they have a waiting period between cards. 

Usually, the limiting factor is meeting the minimum spend requirements of all the cards that you want to apply to. Which brings us back to why you should [track your spending]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/01/01/savings-ratio/ "Which is why you need to track your expenses!") to know how much you will spend in the next 3 months anyway.

## Details

[^1]: If using a credit card increases your spending, or causes you to spend above your means, this stategy is counterproductive at best and will be devastating to your financial health at worst.

[^2]: The interest rate for most credit cards are absurdly high - on the order of magnitude of 20%! While your money at the bank will earn you an interest of sub 3% these days! What's even worst is that the interest is applied to **all** the expenses over the month, not time-weighted. So if you spent a huge amount at the end of the month, it still gets charged that interest fee.

[^3]: Applying for credit cards can briefly lower your credit score as the credit card company makes enquiries of your credit. This effect is temporary, usually sub 6 months, so if you're looking to get a home loan and you're tight on credit (need to borrow a large amount), it's better to wait it out. What's more, any outstanding credit card limits you have (even if you don't use it every month) will be counted against the total amount you can borrow by a multiplicative factor. That is, if your credit limit is $10,000 on your credit card, then the amount you can borrow for a mortgage could well be 5 x $10,000 = $50,000 less otherwise. 

[^4]: The actual value of 100,000 Qantas points is probably slightly less at around $500-$570 once you take into account the extra credit card fees incurred when meeting the minimum spend. With minimum spend of $3,000-$5,000, and 1%-2% surcharge for credit card usage, this amounts to $30-$100 of extra costs.

[^5]: Quick Googling shows that there are 16 million credit cards in Australia, with only 12.5 million in the working age (25-64 y.o.). If the average number of credit cards per credit card holder is 2, then we have roughly 8 million people using credit cards and 4 million in the working population that don't. If each credit card gives $500 of value via introductory bonus points, then in effect, there is a net economic transfer of $1,000 out of non-credit card holders' wallets to pay for credit card holders' benefits. The effect is probably understated, since credit card companies are also profitable. 

[^6]: Since I will be cancelling the card once I've received the points in 3 months time, I don't include the extra 50,000 points on the annual renewal of the card - because by that point, the points don't justify the annual fee.
