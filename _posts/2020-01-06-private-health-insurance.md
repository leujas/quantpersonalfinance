There are two logistical considerations for private health insurance in Australia:
* **Medicare Levy Surcharge (MLS)** - part of the progressive tax system that applies an extra tax of 1-1.5% tax on high income individuals/households, there is no surcharge for individuals making less than $90,000 or famalies making less than $180,000
* **Lifetime Health Cover (LHC)** - if you don't take out adequate private health insurance by the 1<sup>st</sup> of July after your 31<sup>st</sup> birthday, for every year following this, you incur a 2% surcharge on the health insurance premium when you buy health insurance (upper limit of 70%, and removed once adequate cover is taken over 10 consecutive years)[^1]

Actually, perhaps the most important consideration is that:

>Many doctors have told me that, typically, to get the best treatment in Australia, you should neither be a public patient in a public hospital, nor a private patient in a private hospital, but choose to be a private patient in a public hospital. The execeptions are for non-emergency elective surgeries, which may have lower wait times, shorter duration of hospital stay and specialist surgeons at private hospitals/clinics.

### Decision Making

Let's start with the easy math for high income earners. If you're making more than the minimum threshold outlined above, then it is basically always worth it to take out private health insurance immediately, and then disregard LHC. Since 1% surcharge (MLS) on $90,000 is $900 and the lowest tier hospital covers with some excess will cost you around the same (roughly $1,000 give or take $100), buying health insurance is basically using otherwise fully taxed income. If you're getting charged either way, may as well get the health insurance.

For individuals not meeting the MLS surcharge thresholds, the cost benefit analysis depends on (1) your age, and (2) when you expect to buy health insurance. The way to think about this in a simple way, is it will cost roughly $1,000 to buy health insurance now, or you could defer it till later. But defering it till later could cost you extra based on the LHC, so the benefit of deferring it is reduced.

If we make some basic assumptions, the math[^2] suggests that if you don't already have any loading, i.e. you're less than 31 years old or you've had adequate cover since 31, then:

>As long as you plan to take out health insurance in the future, at an age past 31, then the cost of health insurance is really 80% of the current cost.

So if you know that your future income will push you to buy health insurance to negate the MLS, buying health insurance now will cost you about 80% of the quoted price. But at the end of the day, if your post-tax income is $70,000, even a $800 health insurance (80% of $1000) may not be justifiable considering the fairly comprehensive medicare system.

### Bring the Cost to $0

But what if the price of health insurance was $0? Then most of us would agree that it would be worth it. Here's how I have brought my health insurance to $0 via AIA Vitality's generous money back program. Also, I'm not affiliated with AIA Vitality, I just use their product.

First, enroll your health insurance with one of [AIA Vitality's partner programs](https://www.aiavitality.com.au/vmp-au/how_to_join). Second, achieve all of AIA's health rewards, which includes answering questionaires and frequently exercising (via step-counts or gym visits). The rewards you can get from this incentive program include:
- Annual $650 shopping gift cards to be unlocked (includes Woolworths credit)
- Weekly $5 incentive for exercising 

This equates to $910 per year of rewards - and as long as you use this to replace your otherwise normal shopping expenses, this will offset your health insurance costs almost entirely (if we compare to 80% of annual insurance premiums).

There are actually even more discounts for platinum members of AIA Vitality, but unless you're already planning to spend money on some of these expenses, it's not clear it's worth it. 

Perhaps the one that is most useful, though, is the 50% cashback on eligible flights with Virgin Australia. If you're paying for a flight that is tax-deductible, which is the [only time you should be paying for a flight]({{site.baseurl}}/2020/01/04/credit-card_churn/) (use those Credit Card reward points otherwise!), then getting a cashback of 50%[^3] could be meaningful.

I heavily endorse this program mostly because it not only lets you get cash back from private health insurance premiums that otherwise may not be used, but also because you're encouraged to exercise and be healthier at the same time. The incentive structure is well aligned - I stay healthier and reduce my insurance costs, and the insurance company is less likely to pay for me in the future. It's a win-win program.


## Details

[^1]: Actually there are more rules for LHC, which generally don't apply to most people (like being born before 1934, or was overseas on 1Jul00 and turned 31 overseas, or part of the Australian Defense Force). The one that does occasionally come up is that new migrants (other people who get Medicare for the first time) get 12 months to take out health insurance to be exempted from LHC.

[^2]: Basically, since each year past 31 incurs an extra 2% surcharge, which lasts for a maximum of 10 years, but the extra costs can be averaged out among each extra year, then the "extra" cost of not purchasing insurance now is the same as 20%. This assumes cost of health insurance increases at the same rate as inflation, so the real cost stays the same. In reality, the cost of health insurance has increased by much more than inflation, which makes the "extra" cost of not purchase insurance now even more. Vice versa, it means the actual cost of buying health insurance now rather than later is much lower than 80% of the actual cost. 

[^3]: In practice, the actual cashback is closer to a maximum of 30% because of the breakdown in fees which aren't included.
